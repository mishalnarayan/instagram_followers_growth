Sneaky python scripts incrementing you instagram follower daily

***Well the idea behind this is simple. On an average 10-15%(can be increased to 30% with targeted audience) of people follows you back if you follow them.But when you unfollow them, they don't actually unfollow you too.<br>

<br>
So, lets assume a scenario.what if I own a bridal makup instagram page and want to increase my followers, how would i achieve that?<br>

**I can steal my active competitors followers;they will be highly targeted customers.<br>

This script starts with crawling your competitors recent instagram posts and grabs their frequent commentors and post likers.Then follows them, and after a week even if they follow you back or not it will automatically unfollow them.<br>

so on an avg it'll help you grow 20-40 followers a day.Why? because instagram limits you to follow only 200 people on a single day.

It's a great tool for new businesses having struggling followers count.

***It's been proven to provide 500 new relevant followers in 20 days.
